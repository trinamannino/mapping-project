        <p>Cindy Del Villar, 33, runs <a href="https://earlylearningfamilygroupdaycare.wordpress.com/">Early Learning Family Group Daycare</a>, a licensed in-home facility, near Kingsbridge and Fordham in the Bronx. After seeing day cares close in the last 20 months in her area and hearing from parents in need, Del Villar is opening a second location in Norwood. She expects the new space to be open by January.
        </p>

       <p>“I'm the type of person who likes helping and turning down all of these desperate parents was making me feel just horrible,” she said. “And not only were they desperate to find a day care, but they also wanted to find a reliable one.”</p>

       <p>According to a recent report by <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.cccnewyork.org/2021/11/CCC-Household-Pulse-Survey-Analysis-2021.pdf">Citizens’ Committee for Children</a>, 25% of households with children in the New York metro area, have experienced barriers in securing child care.</p>

       <p>Parents are running into a variety of obstacles. Some facilities are at capacity due to understaffing. Centers that have available spots may not accept vouchers—subsidies that many low-income families rely on. And other facilities may not have weathered the pandemic and have closed.</a><br><br><br></p>

        <p><br><br>Del Villar and the parents she serves could benefit from increased child care spending, which is part of President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better Plan. But universal day care remains a sticking point for some. The legislation still has to pass in the Senate.</p>

        <p>Zoraima Rosario-Rolón, a project coordinator at New York Early Childhood Professional Development Institute, said that early childhood education can be met with skepticism by those in power because many individuals who work in the industry don’t have advanced degrees.</p>

        <p>“In the eyes of others, they're just working with babies, and how difficult could that be?” the professional said. “The reality is, it takes far more than that.”</p>

        <p>“You have to be constantly on call, you have to be constantly present and ready to address the needs of a young child.”</p>
        
        <p>Del Villar is undeterred. In addition to opening a second day care, she recently enrolled in a Child Development Associate® (CDA) program. And she spearheaded Bronx Mom Advocate, a Facebook group made up of local moms who are finding ways to create more kids programming in the Bronx.</p>

       </p>For Del Villar, it’s about making a positive impact in her children and clients’ lives. “They're the future,” she said.</p>
